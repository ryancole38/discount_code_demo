## Disclaimer

Router took inspiration from [this example](https://steampixel.de/simple-and-elegant-url-routing-with-php/),
but I made it reusable.

## Self-critiques

- No tests. Don't know PHP well enough.

- Models know FAR too much about the DB for my liking.

- Errors currently unhandled because I'm not quite sure how yet.

- Lack of consistency with terminology (render sometimes means to echo, sometimes returns string)
